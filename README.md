A Sentiment Analysis Project

In today's data-driven world, understanding public sentiment is crucial. This project dives into the realm of sentiment analysis, aiming to automatically classify text data as positive, negative, or neutral. We achieved an impressive accuracy of 89%, allowing us to effectively gauge the sentiment expressed within a piece of text.

Unveiling the Text: 
Preprocessing Techniques--Before diving into the analysis, we meticulously prepared the text data. This preprocessing stage involved several key steps:

•	Punctuation Removal: We stripped away punctuation like commas and periods. While some punctuation can be indicative of sentiment (exclamation marks!), removing most helps the model focus on the core meaning of words.

•	Tokenization with spaCy: spaCy, a powerful natural language processing (NLP) library, came to the rescue. It segmented the text into individual words, or "tokens," making it easier for the model to analyze the content.

•	Stop Word Removal: Common words like "the" and "and" were eliminated. These stop words don't carry much sentiment, and their removal allows the model to focus on content-rich words that hold greater significance.

•	Lemmatization: We transformed words to their base form. For instance, "running" became "run." This ensures the model recognizes different variations of the same word, improving its accuracy.

Feature Engineering: Extracting Meaningful Insights
•	Beyond basic text cleaning, we delved deeper to extract features that would aid the model in sentiment analysis:

•	POS Tagging: We assigned parts-of-speech tags (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to each word.  Adjectives, for example, often express sentiment, and this information helps the model understand the emotional weight of a sentence.

•	Named Entity Recognition (NER) (Optional):  While not always essential, NER can be valuable when sentiment might be tied to specific entities like company names or products. Ignoring these entities could lead to misinterpretations.

Scoring and Representing Text-To quantify the sentiment within the text, we employed the following techniques:

•	Polarity Score: We assigned sentiment scores (positive, negative, or neutral) to individual words or phrases. These scores were then combined to calculate the overall sentiment of the text.

•	CountVectorizer: This technique transformed the preprocessed text data into a numerical format that the model could readily understand. It essentially counts the occurrences of each word in the documents, creating a feature vector that captures the essence of the text.

Building the Model and Measuring Success
Once the data was preprocessed and represented numerically, we were ready to build the sentiment analysis model:

•	Splitting Data: We divided the data into training and testing sets. The training set helps the model learn the patterns of sentiment, while the testing set evaluates its ability to classify unseen data.

•	LinearSVC Algorithm:  We opted for a Linear Support Vector Machine classifier (LinearSVC) due to its efficiency and strong performance in sentiment analysis tasks.

•	Accuracy Score & Classification Report:  The accuracy score provided a general measure of how well the model classified sentiment.  The classification report offered a more detailed breakdown, including precision and recall for each sentiment class (positive, negative, and neutral).

This meticulous process, along with the well-chosen techniques, paved the way for achieving an impressive accuracy of 89%. By unveiling the sentiment hidden within text data, this project opens doors to a deeper understanding of public opinion across various domains.
